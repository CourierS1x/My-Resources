## 🛠 My Projects
- **Detection Rules Repo** – A modular collection of Sigma, SPL, and KQL detections for threat actors and techniques
- **Threat Actor Spotlights** – Deep dive writeups on groups like TA577, Evil Corp, and FIN7 with MITRE mappings
- **CTF Writeups** – Solutions and notes from HTB, TryHackMe, and other platform challenges
- **Cert Guides** – Study roadmaps and summaries for CISSP, CySA+, and more
- **Blue Team Notes** – Hunting hypotheses, log source mapping, and detection tuning insights

- Studying for CISSP (in progress)
- Labs and hands-on work using:
  - Splunk
  - Elastic Stack
  - Sysmon + Sigma
  - MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

## 🔍 Featured Research Topics
- **TA577: Malspam to Cobalt Strike** → [View Writeup](https://d3adair.xyz/threat-intel/actors/TA577)
- **Gameover ZeuS** – Malware lineage, behavior, and detection pathways
- **Detection Engineering** – Behavioral signatures, low-noise rules, and hunt-first logic
- **Hunt Development** – Building hypotheses from threat reports and pivoting via logs

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- "Behavior over IOCs"
- Mapping all detections to ATT&CK where possible
- Real-world tested queries (not copy/paste rules)
- Linking blog content directly to GitHub detection use cases
